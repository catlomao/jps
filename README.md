# UPDATE 2024/07/16 !
## instend of me being lazy using chatgpt i decided to fix it myself (reverse.py)
## also made it a pkg too
# jps
**A  simple Python Program that translate EN spelling into JP**
the project comes with three different types of running it
 1. as a pkg aka module
 2. Source code
 3. The already built file which is jps .exe
 # 1. as a pkg aka module
 - you can download in the main branch
 # examples

```py
import jpspkg
print(jpspkg.hiragana("ko n ni chi wa"))
```
if you wanna use both
## or
```py
from jpspkg import hiragana
print(hiragana("ko n ni chi wa"))
```
if you want to use hiragana only
```py
from jpspkg import katakana
print(katakana("ko n ni chi wa"))
```
if you want to use katakana only
# 2. Source code
- again you can download the py file or source code in the main branch
### run it
```konsole
python jps.py
```
that it!
# 3. The already built file which is jps .exe
- AGAIN you can download the jps.exe file in the release section
***just download it and click the jps.exe file***
# ⚠️ the exe file might not always work, it didnt work with wine maybe it would work in your windows machine
